1. What is a Node module?
	A: A node module is essential just a library that we can create, edit, and link to our application. Modules are the building blocks of a server side application. Modules must be exported from their location and imported ('required') to the main application where they will be used.

2. What is the main difference between exports and module.exports?
	A: Export is just a reference to module.exports. Exports can not assign values to module.exports, which is an object. 

3. Why is using exports recommended?
	A: Exports is a safer alternative as we can’t change the values or override the module.exports object.
